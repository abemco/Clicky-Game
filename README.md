# Clicky-Game

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This game is a memory game built with React. I did use Indiana Jones carachters as an ideia of the upgraded game we did on week 4 of the Bootcamp (<a href="https://abemco.github.io/week-4-game/">Crystal Game</a>) that I used the same theme.</p>

<p>The goal of this game is not to click on any character more than once. If you select a chracter for second time the game will restart and if all characters are selected once, the selected characters will reset.</p>
