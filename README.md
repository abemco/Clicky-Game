# Clicky-Game

Overview
This game is a memory game built with React. I did use Indiana Jones carachters as an ideia of the upgraded game we did on week 4 of the Bootcamp (crystal Game) that I used the same theme. 

The goal of this game is not to click on any character more than once. If you select a chracter for second time the game will restart and if all characters are selected once, the selected characters will reset.
